Background:
Integration tests involving external services were unreliable and slow,
primarily due to the dependency on these external services' availability and response times.

Solution:
The team implemented asynchronous mock services using asyncio,
mimicking the behavior of external dependencies. These mock services could handle multiple incoming connections concurrently,
offering predictable response times and allowing for more reliable and consistent integration testing.

Challenges:
Reliance on external services for integration testing introduces variability in test execution times and can lead to flaky tests,
especially when these services are slow or unavailable.

asyncio Application:
Creating asynchronous mock services using asyncio provides a controlled environment for integration testing,
with the ability to simulate various responses and conditions of external services.
These mocks can handle numerous connections simultaneously, offering consistent and predictable response times.

Anticipated Outcomes:
Using asynchronous mock services can lead to more reliable and faster integration tests,
reducing the impact of external dependencies on test stability. It allows for comprehensive testing of error handling and edge cases,
improving the robustness of the application.
