Background:
A software development team found that their CI pipeline was often a bottleneck,
with automated tests taking too long to run, delaying feedback to developers.

Solution:
Integrating asyncio into their testing framework, the team was able to parallelize test execution,
particularly for I/O-bound tests such as database operations, file uploads, and external API calls.
This reduced the CI pipeline's execution time, providing faster feedback to developers and improving the overall efficiency of the development process.


Challenges:
Lengthy execution times for automated tests in CI pipelines delay feedback to developers and can bottleneck the development process,
especially when dealing with I/O-bound operations.

asyncio Application:
By parallelizing test execution, especially for I/O-bound tests, with asyncio,
the overall runtime of test suites in CI pipelines can be significantly reduced.
Tests that were previously run synchronously and blocked on I/O operations can now be executed concurrently.

Anticipated Outcomes:
Shorter CI pipeline execution times lead to faster feedback for developers,
enhancing productivity and accelerating the development cycle. It also enables more frequent runs of the test suite,
increasing the overall quality of the software.
